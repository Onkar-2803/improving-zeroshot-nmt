# Improving Zero-shot Translation of Low-resource Languages
## Abstract
This repository is used to adapt (from OpenNMT-py v1.??) and implement the paper (Improving Zero-shot Translation of Low-resource Languages), the new implementation/changes on top of OpenNMT-py includes: 
- simplified training and inference procedure specific the TIF approach 
- OPTIONS: to load or avoid the optimizer and associated hyper-parameters 
- PIPLINE: preprocessing, training and inference scripts 
- EVALUATION: standard and new evaluation and visualization scripts ()
